# -VSN-AQIR-ADS
Adaptive Quantum Im- age Representation with Adaptive Depth Suppression (AQIR-ADS), a frame- work explicitly designed around NISQ-era constraints. Gradient-weighted ro- tational encoding allocates quantum resources preferentially to structurally  significant image regions, while unnecessary entanglement and excess circuit depth are suppressed.
